## Regulations
Must be kept:
- as short as possible.

In POSIX, a [text file](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap03.html#tag_03_403) has zero or more lines, and a [line](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap03.html#tag_03_206) is terminated with a newline character.

Should be kept:
- can execute on command-line.
- use major compiler, don't use hacks depend on compiler.
